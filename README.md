WELCOME TO BLUE SCREEN OF JUSTICE'S LIT HACKATHON GITHUP REPOSITORY !!!

WE CURRENTLY HAVE 2 LEGAL ASSISTANTS USING DIFFERENT LLMS ( CLAUDE & GPT ) in the files named CLAUDE_LEGAL_ASSISTANT.py and GPT4_LEGAL_ASSISTANT.py
BOTH LEGAL ASSISTANTS USE AN AGENTIC WORKFLOW USING LANGGRAPH AND LANGCHAIN LIBRARIES TO FEED OUTPUT FROM THE SAME LLM BACK INTO ITSELF WITH A DIFFERENT FORMATTING STYLE, AND OUR OWN PROMPTING FOR EACH AGENT
WE HAVE A PARALEGAL PROMPT, PARALEGAL ARBITRATION PROMPT, PARALEGAL COUNTERARGUMENT PROMPT, AND THE SAME FOR THE DEFENDANT.

EACH ASSISTANT CREATES HAS A LANGCHAIN EACH FOR A PARALEGAL ARGUMENT AND A DEFENDANT ARGUMENT, AND EVENTUALLY BOTH ARGUMENTS ARE FED INTO A JUDGE AGENT WHICH ANALYSES BOTH SIDES AND PROVIDES A FINAL VERDICT
A LANGGRAPH IS USED AS WE ARE CROSSING EACH CHAIN AT THE COUNTERARGUMENT PROMPT AS WE ASK THE DEFENDANT AGENT TO FIND COUNTERARGUMENTS FOR THE PARALEGAL AGENT'S ARGUMENT AND VICE VERSA

EVENTUALLY, A MARKDOWN FILE IS CREATED IN THE RESPECTIVE FOLDERS, GPT4_markdown_outputs and CLAUDE_markdown_outputs so that lawyers are able to easily access and see the different frameworks in each API call and the output.
The final analysis is also sent to a markdown file!

FINAL EDIT !!!
WE ARE USING RETRIEVAL AUGMENTED GENERATION (RAG) TO PARSE THE JSON DATA FROM JUS MUNDI FOR THE LLM TO PARSE TO SUPPORT ITS RESPONSE IN OUR LATEST FILE (RAG_CLAUDE_LEGAL_ASSISTANT.py) !!! THIS IS SO COOL !!!
